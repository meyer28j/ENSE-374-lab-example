What I've listened to most recently:

Latest Full-Album Listen:       "The Wall" by Pink Floyd
Latest Re-Discovered Artist:    Queen
    --- I was blown away by their genre versatility: they can go from
    operatic-classical to metal in one song. Badass.
Latest "Favourite" Song:        "Parabola" (followed by "Ticks & Leeches") by Tool

#1 Album of All Time:           "Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory" by Dream Theater
Favourite Band of All Time:     Rush
